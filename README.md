# Toronto Bikeshare Ridership Data Engineering

# Project Overview:

This repository contains a comprehensive data engineering project developed as part of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp. The project focuses on processing bikeshare data from Toronto Open Data, specifically the bikeshare-ridership dataset. This dataset provides detailed records of bike trips, including trip duration, station details, and user types.

Dataset Fields:

- Trip Id – Unique identifier for each trip
- Trip Duration – Total duration of the trip
- Start Station Id – Identifier for the starting station
- Start Time – Timestamp when the trip began
- Start Station Name – Name of the starting station
- End Station Id – Identifier for the destination station
- End Time – Timestamp when the trip ended
- End Station Name – Name of the destination station
- Bike Id – Unique identifier for the bike used
- User Type – Classification of the user (e.g., annual, casual)

By implementing batch processing pipelines, this project ensures efficient data ingestion and transformation on a scheduled basis, enabling data analysts to derive meaningful insights from Toronto's bikeshare ridership trends.

## Objectives:

The primary objective of this project is to build automated data pipelines that extract bikeshare data from the open data platform, transform it to ensure cleanliness and structure, and store it in Google BigQuery for further analysis. The processed data will be used for various analytical applications, such as generating insightful dashboards and conducting historical trend analysis to support decision-making.
